# Data-X: Hondezvous x 99P Labs: Vehicle Destination & Dwell Time Prediction Project
## Project Overview:
### Value Proposition:
#### Give your car a new purpose.

Have you ever needed something delivered to you while you’re at work? Have you ever wanted your car repaired while you’re out at the movies? What about earning passive income from your parked car?

**With our solutions, you can make your car a delivery location,  get services on the move, and enter your car into the gig economy.**
### Summary:
We teamed up with 99P Labs to work on building predictive models for dwell time duration and location, giving drivers the ability to opt-in to a variety of services, such as Amazon Key, and giving partner services the ability to thrive in a hungry market.

### Objective:
A crucial step towards our team’s success was approaching the problem through an entrepreneurial lens, not as data scientists and engineers; and doing so, we were able to start asking the right questions. We shifted our thinking from “Can we create a probability distribution for a car’s dwell time given a location?” to **“Can this service be fulfilled or not?”** We restructured our approach to the model implementations to predict a binary yes or no rather than an exact distribution. This switch in approach better fit what our service providers were looking for and helped us optimize accuracy.

## Approach
* Clustering/KNN Model


* Markov Model
